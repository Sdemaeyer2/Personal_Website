This research project aims to understand the process of how students differ in watching online instructional videos in a flipped classroom and how different strategies of processing these videos before attending the classroom are related to differences in student in-classroom behavior and student academic performance. 

Three research questions are put forward: 

- RQ1: Can we detect patterns in students watching behavior while learning from instructional videos that are indicative of the learning strategies students use to cognitively process the information in these videos? 
- RQ2: How are differences in students processing strategies while learning from instructional videos in a flipped classroom related to differences in students' in-classroom learning behavior? 
- RQ3: How are differences in students processing strategies while learning from instructional videos in a flipped classroom related to differences in student academic performance? 

Research question one will be investigated in a lab study in which 90 students in social sciences will participate. Research questions two and three will be investigated in a field study in a statistics course in the faculty of social sciences. Both the lab study and the field study will combine trace data with qualitative data.
