The Digital Platform for the Assessment of Competences (D-Pac) is an innovative tool for assessing a wide range of competences, based on the method of Comparative Judgement. It can be used within a variety of contexts (e.g., for writing ability, self-reflection, and problem-solving) and for different purposes (e.g., for formative evaluation, peer assessment, research, selection, etc.).

Comparative Judgement  is based on Thurstoneâ€™s Law of Comparative Judgement. This law stipulates that people are better and more reliable in comparing two things than in assigning an absolute score to (only) one thing.

D-PAC was a four year IWT-SBO funded research project. Project partners were University of Antwerp,
Ghent University and iMinds (now: imec). During this project, the merits of comparative judgement
for the assessment of competencies were investigated. Research provided detailed insights into the
reliability, validity and efficiency of the method. Moreover, feedback opportunities towards assessees
and organisations were explored. In total, the award-winning D-PAC project will result in four doctoral
dissertations.
