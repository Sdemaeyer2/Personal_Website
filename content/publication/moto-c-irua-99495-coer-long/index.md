abstract: "Whether or not learning strategies change during the course of higher education is an important topic in the Student Approaches to Learning field. However, there is a dearth of any empirical evaluations in the literature as to whether or not the instruments in this research domain measure equivalently over time. Therefore, this study details the procedure of longitudinal measurement invariance testing of self-report Likert-type scales, using the case of learning strategies. The sample consists of 245 University College students who filled out the Inventory of Learning StylesShort Version three times. Using the WLSMV estimator to take into account the ordinal nature of the data, a series of models with progressively more stringent constraints were estimated using Mplus 6.1. The results indicate that longitudinal measurement invariance holds for all but two learning strategy scales. The implications for longitudinal analysis using scales with varying degrees of measurement invariance are discussed."
