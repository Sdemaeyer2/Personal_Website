abstract: "In knowledge based economies technological literacy is gaining interest. Technological literacy correlates with the attitude towards technology, therefore, when measuring technological literacy as an outcome of education, one should take the attitude towards technology into account. This requires a valid, reliable instrument that should be as concise as possible, in order to use it in correlation with other instruments. We therefore reconstructed the Pupils Attitude Towards Technology (PATT) instrument. We validated and piloted this and used it in a large study. This resulted in an instrument with six subscales and 24 items of attitude towards technology that is easy to use and evaluate. The six items are: Career Aspirations, Interest in Technology, Tediousness of Technology, Positive Perception of Effects of Technology, Perception of Difficulty and Perception of Technology as a Subject for Boys or for Boys and Girls."
