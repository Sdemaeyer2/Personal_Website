abstract: "Educational stakeholders generally assume that inspection feedback directly contributes to school improvement through the mechanism of feedback acceptance. Feedback research in general distinguishes between cognitive and affective responses as significant factors for feedback acceptance, but it also focuses on cognitive responses as antecedents of emotions and emphasises the interplay between cognition, emotions, and feedback acceptance. Quantitative evidence in external school evaluation research to support this view, however, is rather scarce. This study draws on quantitative data collected from 687 teachers in 80 Flemish primary schools that had recently been inspected. Using path analysis, we investigated the existence and strength of relationships between teachers’ cognitive and affective responses and teachers’ feedback acceptance. The analysis revealed that anger and feedback acceptance are predominantly explained by the perceived fairness of the evaluation process and outcome but that they are also explained by the perceived relevance of the provided feedback."
