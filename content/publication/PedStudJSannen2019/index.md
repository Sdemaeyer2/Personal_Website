abstract: "A social network approach provides a valuable framework to assess and strengthen teacher
collaboration, which is considered important in realizing inclusive education. However, to
our knowledge, there is no research that has used a social network approach to measure
and strengthen teacher collaboration in the context of inclusive education. Therefore,
this study aims to develop and validate a social network instrument that provides
teachers, school teams and researchers insight into teacher collaboration in the
light of inclusive education. Regarding the development, specific issues that need to be
taken into account in developing a network questionnaire are shown and applied.
Regarding the validation, evidence on the content, response processes and internal
structure of the instrument are provided. Additionally, the cognitive load to complete
the instrument and the value of feedback after completing the instrument are studied.
Data were gathered in three primary and two secondary schools through a mixed method
design, using an online questionnaire (N = 91) and focus groups and interviews with
a subset of the participants (N = 23). The findings suggest that our instrument is a
valid tool to assess teacher collaboration, and to strengthen teacher collaboration by
providing teachers and teams feedback on their networks. "
