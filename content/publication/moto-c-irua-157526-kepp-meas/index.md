abstract: "This study reports on the development and validation of a video-based measurement instrument to assess pre-service teachers' (n = 278) professional vision of inclusive classrooms (PVIC). PVIC includes two dimensions of teacher quality that are essential in effective inclusive classrooms: (positive) teacher student interactions (T51) and differentiated instruction (DI). It is the first study to measure pre-service teachers' professional vision through a holistic video-based approach using comparative judgement The validity framework of Chan (2014) was used to investigate construct validity. The results show that the instrument is reliable and valid, and recommendations for use in teacher education programs are formulated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
