 abstract = {The objective of this research is to determine whether there is a relationship between learning conceptions of twelve-year-old students in the last year of primary education and their learning outcomes. The results of this study indicate that learning outcomes are significantly lower when students in the last year of primary education score high on the variables undirected learning and regulation by the teacher. In practice these results, and the fact that learning conceptions are liable to change during the transition from primary to secondary education, mean that the stimulation of students in terms of the correct form of regulation, using more deep processing activities, instead of undirected behaviour by the processing of subject matter, possibly gives better learning outcomes.},
