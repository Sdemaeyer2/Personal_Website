abstract: "This study examines the influence of personality traits, goal orientation and self-efficacy on high school teachers participation in learning activities in the workplace (i.e. experimentation, informal interaction with colleagues, selfregulation and avoidance behaviour). A convenience sample of 95 teachers from six high schools in Flanders (Belgium) participated in this exploratory study. They completed a questionnaire consisting of different instruments to map their personality (NEO-FFI), goal orientation (adaptation of Achievement Goal Questionnaire), selfefficacy (Teachers Sense of Efficacy Scale) and participation in learning activities (adaptations from different scales). Results of multivariate regression analyses indicate that conscientiousness, extraversion and openness have a positive effect on teachers participation in learning activities in the workplace. However, learning orientation and self-efficacy are found to be better predictors for participation in experimentation, informal interaction and selfregulation. Analysis using structural equation modeling reveals an indirect relationship between extraversion and selfregulation, mediated by self-efficacy. Learning orientation mediates the impact of conscientiousness on informal interaction. As teachers goal orientation and selfefficacy can be influenced, school policy makers should reflect upon ways on how teachers goal orientation and self-efficacy can further be enhanced."
