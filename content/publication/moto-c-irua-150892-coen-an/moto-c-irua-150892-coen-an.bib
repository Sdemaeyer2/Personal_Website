 abstract = {A Design Science Research project is presented, describing the creation of an Information System for the assessment of human competences while supporting learning. First, requirements that emanate from current mainstream competence evaluation practice are introduced. Then, design principles are presented to address the design requirements. Finally, design features are discussed that represent a concrete instantiation of the design principles in a working system prototype. The output of the design, development, and evaluation of the artefact are presented as an Information Systems Design Theory. This theory provides principles that can be applied in different contexts where the evaluation of competences is needed.},
