abstract: "In many educational systems, diverse examples of school self-evaluation procedures entered the quality control system. Such school self-evaluations confront schools in different ways with specific challenges. Besides policy related aspects also a number of research-oriented aspects are expected to impact the quality of school self-evaluation processes. This study firstly maps the extent to which school self-evaluations meet policy and research-based requirements according to teachers. Secondly, it considers whether differences in the course of self-evaluations can be explained by characteristics of school culture. Based on an online survey with 1,500 teachers a path model that addresses these questions is tested. The results show that teachers are only moderately positive about the self-evaluation processes in their school and that cultural characteristics determine the proper conduct of the self-evaluation, but only to a minor extent."
