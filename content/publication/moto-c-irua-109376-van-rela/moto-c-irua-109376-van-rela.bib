 abstract = {Recently, increasing research attention is devoted to the informal workplace learning of teachers. Little is known about individual characteristics of teachers influencing their informal workplace learning. This study examines the relations between personality, motivation and informal workplace learning of Flemish high school teachers. Informal workplace learning is thereby operationalized as on the one hand participating in learning activities at the workplace (experimenting, informal interaction with colleagues, self-regulation) and on the other hand avoidance behaviour. 95 teachers participated in the survey. Results of multivariate regression analysis indicate that conscientiousness, openness and extraversion have a moderate to strong positive effect on informal workplace learning. Motivation was found to be a stronger predictor of informal workplace learning than personality. Mediation analysis points at the existence of an indirect relationship of extraversion on experimenting by self-efficacy. Indications were found for a partly mediated effect of openness on informal interaction by learning goal orientation.},
