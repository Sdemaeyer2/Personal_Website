abstract: "The present study looked at the amount of input and output in two groups of children and their normally hearing mothers: congenitally hearing-impaired children with a cochlear implant (CI) and normally hearing children (NH). The aim of the study was threefold: (a) to investigate the input provided by the two groups of mothers, (b) to investigate the output of the two groups of children, and (c) to investigate the influence of the mothers input on childrens output and on their expressive vocabulary sizes. Mothers are less influenced by their childrens hearing status than children are: CI children are more talkative and slower speakers. Mothers influenced their children on most measures, but the most striking finding is that not mothers talkativeness as such, but the number of maternal turns out to be the best predictor of childrens expressive vocabulary size."
