abstract: "Evidence regarding the impact of teachers' instructional development on student learning in higher education is scarce. In this study the authors investigate the impact of an instructional development programme for beginning university teachers on students' approach to studying. They also explore whether this impact is dependent on class size and student level (first years versus non-first years). Quantitative data were gathered from more than 1000 students at pre-tests and post-tests, using a quasi-experimental design. A multilevel analysis was then conducted in which five models were estimated. The results show limited effects of teachers' instructional development. Several interpretations and perspectives for research into instructional development are discussed"
