 abstract = {The Approaches to Teaching Inventory (ATI) is used to examine teachers teaching approaches in higher education. Analyses into the validity and reliability of the original English ATI yielded positive results. In this study, we examined the degree to which these positive results can also be found for the Dutch version that we developed. Data were gathered from 377 teachers at the University of Antwerp (Flanders, Belgium) and three Antwerp university colleges. Confirmatory factor analyses and principal factor analyses with oblique rotation support a model with sub-factors belonging to two main factors. Our research supports the reliability and validity of our current Dutch version of the ATI. Consequently, the instrument can be used in educational research or practice to obtain insights into the teaching approach of teachers. Further research into differences in the structure of the ATI when used in different cultures would be valuable.},
