 abstract = {Nowadays, comparative judgment (CJ) emerged as an alternative method for assessing competences and performances (e.g. Pollitt, 2012). In this method, various assessors compare independently several representations of different students and decide each time which of them demonstrate the best performance of the given competence. This study investigated students attitudes (honesty, relevancy and trustworthiness) towards feedback that is based upon this method. Additionally, it studied the importance of specific tips in CJ-based feedback.},
