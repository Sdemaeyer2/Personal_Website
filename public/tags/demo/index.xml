      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Digital Platform for the Assessment of Competences &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.d-pac.be/english/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;D-PAC&lt;/a&gt; is an innovative tool for assessing a wide range of competences, based on the method of Comparative Judgement. It can be used within a variety of contexts (e.g., for writing ability, self-reflection, and problem-solving) and for different purposes (e.g., for formative evaluation, peer assessment, research, selection, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparative Judgement  is based on Thurstoneâ€™s Law of Comparative Judgement. This law stipulates that people are better and more reliable in comparing two things than in assigning an absolute score to (only) one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
