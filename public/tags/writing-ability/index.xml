&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;LIFT project&lt;/strong&gt; (Improving pre-university studentsâ€™ performance in academic synthesis tasks with Level up Instructions and Feedback tool) is an NWO-funded project in which we study text quality and writing processes of syntheiss texts. The aim of the study is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map the development of text quality, writing processes and writer characteristics over the grades (Grade 10-11-12),
Investigate the link between different aspects of the writing process and the quality of the synthesis text (and the relation to personal writer characteristics),
Develop feedback on the both the product (text quality) and the writing process of synthesis texts (and to test its effect),
Develop instruction to improve synthesis writing (and to test its effect).&lt;/p&gt;
