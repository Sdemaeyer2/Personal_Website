      <description>&lt;p&gt;If we use the eye tracker to register eye movements while assessors compare two texts in Comparative Judgement, we are confronted with the question of how to model the resulting data statistically. In this presentation we talk more specifically about the modeling of &amp;lsquo;Gaze event durations&amp;rsquo;. We demonstrate the added value of a &lt;em&gt;finite mixture model&lt;/em&gt; and present the results of analyses using bayesian estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the presentation we present different statistical models that can be the basis of the resulting data. In the finite mixture models we start from potentially 2 cognitive processes which determine how long assessors look during a visit to an AOI (in this case an AOI is equal to one of the two texts they look at): one process we call &amp;lsquo;scanning&amp;rsquo; for the time being (short registered times in one of the two texts to quickly form an image of the text), the other process we call &amp;lsquo;reading for text comprehension&amp;rsquo; (longer registered times in one of the two texts where the text is read systematically).&lt;/p&gt;
