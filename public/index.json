And how to make sense out of all these Bayesian mishmash? After some reading around (and learning of course) I started to get a first understanding of some key concepts. And now I want to share my insights with you.\nIn this post I’ll try to explain the basics and explain 5 key concepts. But before that, a short sidestep on the goal of stats (because sometimes we seem to forget).\nStats? Why? To put it simple: stats help us to model reality in numbers and assist us in getting better insight in the world. Let’s say we have a major concern on the rise of vampires in Europe 1. Rumours are getting spread saying that the almost 20% of the Europeans is actually a vampire, but nobody really has a good idea on the number of vampires. The major question then is: how many vampires are out there? This is a statistical question that can be approached by a pretty simple model: the proportion of vampires among the whole population of Europeans. This model only contains one unknown value: the actual proportion of vampires. This unknown value is what we often call a parameter. We can calculate the exact proportion in the exceptional case that we can test every single one of the whole European population. But that’s utopia. In research most of the time we make use of samples (we test a random choosen number of European citizens) and we do not calculate the exact parameter value. We estimate the parameter value. Statistics help us to estimate parameter values. But it does even more. Good statistics also quantifies the (un)certainty on our parameter estimate(s)! If we apply this to our question concerning the proportion of vampires, we want statistics to help us quantify how certain we are about different proportions of vampires as the true proportion in the population.\nThis brings us to our two first concepts from Bayesian analysis: priors and posteriors.\n Priors and posteriors Bayesian statistics calls the quantification of uncertainty on parameter estimates priors and posteriors. So both concepts refer to some kind of probability.\nLets start with the prior.\n A prior is a quantification of (un)certainty on parameter estimates that we have before we consider the information in the data that we gather.\n Back to our example of vampires. A prior can quantify our prior knowledge on the probability that any possible proportion of vampires is the true proportion in Europe. Now, imagine that we do not have any clue before we start our research then each proportion has the same probability. The following plot shows our prior! Note that we have no data yet. So this graph visualizes our prior knowledge about the proportion of vampires.\nOf course, in research we gather data. In our example we’re lucky that we have prof. dr. Van Helsing 2. He’s a famous professor who developed the ultimate Vampire Test that determines whether a person is a vampire or not. As a succesfull professor he was able to get research funding from the European Commission. In his step of the research he had the silly idea to gather data in a sample of n=1: he tested one random European citizen. And the result was that this random person is not a vampire. Now, given his data we can update our knowledge on our parameter. We now know that it is impossible that 100% of the Europeans are vampires. So we adapt our pior probability to what is called a posterior probability! The next plot shows what happens. The red area in the graph is our posterior distribution, demonstrating that we no longer assign any probability that the proportion of vampires is 100% and that the probabilities increase as the proportion of vampires decreases.\n A posterior is a quantification of (un)certainty on parameter estimates that we have taking into account the information in the data that we gather.\n In work package 2 prof. dr. Van Helsing was able to draw a random sample of 200 Europeans and he applied his test. This resulted in data containing 21 vampires and 179 normal persons. This data can be used to update our knowledge on our parameter. The result is visualized in the next plot wher the curve (and area) plotted at line “n=200” is actually the posterior probability distribution for our parameter.\nWe can actually zoom in to our posterior distribution that looks like this:\nThe dashed line indicates the median of our posterior distribution which can be seen as the most probable proportion of vampires in Europe (being 0.107 or 10.7%) given our sample. But other proportions are plausible as well. To help us with making inferences to the population based on our posterior probability distribution, we can make use of a HPDI!\n HPDI In comes our third term: the Highest Probability Density Interval (HPDI).\n An HPDI is an interval between two parameter values (limits) that contain the a predefined number of most plausible parameter values.\n This definition may sound a bit abstract, but if we apply it to our example it will hopefully become more clear. First, we have to define how large an interval we wish. For example, we could be interested in the 90% most plausible parameter estimates. So, we construct a 90% HPDI. Let’s apply this to our example:\nquantile(Vamp_Posterior$Vamp_Posterior,c(0.05, 0.95)) ## 5% 95% ## 0.07535876 0.14763525 Concerning the proportion of vampires our posterior learns us that the 90% most plausible proportions of vampires are situated between 7.5% and 14.7%. Notice that the 20% vampires in Europe, the number being mentioned in some rumours is not within this interval. As usual, do not always take rumours too seriously.\nStill two concept to go: MCMC and Bayesian Theorem. Let’s start with the latter as untill now we didn’t explain how we could update our priors to result in posteriors. The core of this proces is the Bayesian Theorem.\n Bayesian Theorem Bayesian analysis has received this name because at the heart of this type of analysis is the Bayesian Theorem that is used to update prior probabilities into posterior probabilities. The Bayesian Theorem is formally the following:\n\\[Pr(B|A) = \\frac{Pr(A|B)*Pr(A)}{Pr(B)}\\]\nThat looks complex and is typical probability theory stuff. In textbooks on Bayesian analyses this theorem is explained into detail. But, in my opinion for now it is more interesting to show you how this theorem is applied on priors and posteriors. In Bayesian analysis we are interested in the probability of parameter values given the data, something we earlier on labeled as the posterior (probability). If we apply the Bayesian theorem to this probability then we can write it down like this:\n\\[Pr(parameter|Data) = \\frac{Pr(Data|parameter)*Pr(parameter)}{Pr(Data)}\\]\nThis formula states how we can calculate the posterior. If we replace some terms by more meaningful terms it can become more clear what’s happening:\n\\[Posterior = \\frac{Pr(Data|parameter)*Prior}{Pr(Data)}\\]\nHow the other unknown terms are calculated \\(Pr(Data|parameter)\\) and \\(Pr(Data)\\) is something that can be learned in specific textbooks. More importantly I hope you get the idea! The only thing left to explain is how it works now. What does the estimation proces look like? Time to introduce MCMC…\n MCMC The estimation process of Bayesian analyses can take many forms. The basic idea is that the formula from above is applied to each possible value of a paramater. In our vampire example this would imply that we do a calculation for each possible value between 0% vampires and 100% vampires so that each possible proportion gets an associated posterior probability. For a model like ours with only one parameter this is a job that may be handled easily by our modern computers 3. Of course, in real life research we apply more complex models. Imagine that you want to apply this to a regression model with 3 independent variables. The equation looks something like this:\n\\[Y_i = \\beta_0 * Cons + \\beta_1 * X_1 + \\beta_2 * X_2 + \\beta_3 * X_3 + \\epsilon_i\\]\nThis model contains 5 parameters to estimate! And even more importantly, a very very large number of combinations of parameter values for these parameters can be made. If we had to calculate the posterior probability for each and every possible combination we would have to wait for hours (or days, or weeks) before our computer throws back the results to us. This is where MCMC comes in the picture!\nIn the search for more efficient ways to apply Bayesian analyses, researchers have developed a smart sampling method: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.\n MCMC is a sampling method used in many scientific fields and also used in Bayesian statistical estimation. The sampling method is not random but uses an informed algorithm to sample the most informative samples of values of the parameter space.\n The take-away message is that this MCMC sampling is a more efficient way to sample combinations of parameter values. In Bayesian analysis this sampling technicque is applied and for each sample of parameter values the algorith calculates the posterior distribution. By repeating this sampling a large number of times we get enough information to build a completer picture of the posterior distribution for all parameter values.\n to end… I hope you have some first impressions or ideas about the meaning of these 5 key concepts in Bayesian analysis.

The current study captures these issues by offering an alternative assessment method (Comparative Judgment) in which the interrater reliability and construct validity of the resume screening is studied: several assessors with different levels of expertise assess resumes comparatively. In this study, resumes from 42 candidates applying for an existing vacancy were used. These resumes were directly compared by experienced (N = 7; experts), and less experienced assessors (N = 57; students). Results show that the comparative judgements of experienced assessors are linked to valid and reliable resume screening. The inter-rater reliability of the student assessments was lower than that of the experts. Even though the final rank ordering of the resumes correlated, students often relied on irrelevant aspects in the resumes.","tags":null,"title":"De comparatieve beoordelingsmethode voor een betrouwbare en valide cv-screening: een vergelijking tussen experts en studenten","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

Sometimes, these criteria are also illustrated with examples of varying quality. It is, however, not yet clear how students learn from shared criteria and examples. This research aims to investigate the learning effects of two different instructional approaches: applying criteria to examples and comparative judgment. International business students were instructed to write a five-paragraph essay, preceded by a 30-min peer assessment in which they evaluated the quality of a range of example essays. Half of the students evaluated the quality of the example essays using a list of teacher-designed criteria (criteria condition; n = 20), the other group evaluated by pairwise comparisons (comparative judgment condition; n = 20). Students were also requested to provide peer feedback. Results show that the instructional approach influenced the kind of aspects students commented on when giving feedback. Students in the comparative judgment condition provided relatively more feedback on higher order aspects such as the content and structure of the text than students in the criteria condition. This was only the case for improvement feedback; for feedback on strengths there were no significant differences. Positive effects of comparative judgment on students' own writing performance were only moderate and non-significant in this small sample. Although the transfer effects were inconclusive, this study nevertheless shows that comparative judgment can be as powerful as applying criteria to examples. Comparative judgement inherently activates students to engage with exemplars at a higher textual level and enables students to evaluate more example essays by comparison than by criteria. Further research is needed on the long-term and indirect effects of comparative judgment, as it might influence students' conceptualization of writing, without directly improving their writing performance.","tags":null,"title":"Applying criteria to examples or learning by comparison : effects on students' evaluative judgment and performance in writing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Renske Bouwer","Maarten Goossens","Anneleen Viona Mortier","Marije Lesterhuis","Sven De Maeyer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"4ff5cf86a553d578a79b3d2d1ea03af5","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-149795-bouw-comp/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.568512Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-149795-bouw-comp/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Een comparatieve aanpak voor peer assessment : leren door te vergelijken","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leen Catrysse","David Gijbels","Vincent Donche","Sven De Maeyer","Marije Lesterhuis","Piet Van den Bossche"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"93a610be21b804490eeb6fea01b956df","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-145583-catr-how/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.559362Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-145583-catr-how/","section":"publication","summary":"Background Up until now, empirical studies in the Student Approaches to Learning field have mainly been focused on the use of self-report instruments, such as interviews and questionnaires, to uncover differences in students' general preferences towards learning strategies, but have focused less on the use of task-specific and online measures.

Methods Eye-tracking data were analysed with generalized linear mixed-effects models. Results The results indicate that students with an all-high profile, combining both deep and surface learning strategies, spend more time on rereading the text than students with an all-low profile, scoring low on both learning strategies.

Assessors are asked to compare pairs of students work (representations) and judge which one is better on a certain competence. These judgments are analyzed using the BradlyTerryLuce model resulting in logit estimates for the representations. In this context, the Scale Separation Reliability (SSR), coming from Rasch modeling, is typically used as reliability measure. But, to the knowledge of the authors, it has never been systematically investigated if the meaning of the SSR can be transferred from Rasch to CJ. As the meaning of the reliability is an important question for both assessment theory and practice, the current study looks into this. A meta-analysis is performed on 26 CJ assessments. For every assessment, split-halves are performed based on assessor. The rank orders of the whole assessment and the halves are correlated and compared with SSR values using BlandAltman plots. The correlation between the halves of an assessment was compared with the SSR of the whole assessment showing that the SSR is a good measure for split-half reliability. Comparing the SSR of one of the halves with the correlation between the two respective halves showed that the SSR can also be interpreted as an interrater correlation. Regarding SSR as expressing a correlation with the truth, the results are mixed.","tags":null,"title":"Scale separation reliability : what does it mean in the context of comparative judgment?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jerich Faddar","Jan Vanhoof","Sven De Maeyer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"23662d9d621d81ad7b17453c0d5c5450","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-155542-fadd-scho/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.586689Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-155542-fadd-scho/","section":"publication","summary":"In order to enhance the quality of education, school self-evaluation (SSE) has become a key strategy in many educational systems.

Literature distinguishes several aspects of feedback that stimulate or hinder the acceptance of feedback, such as recipient's cognitive and affective responses to feedback. This study investigates teachers' cognitive and affective responses to school inspection feedback in relation to feedback acceptance. It draws on data from 21 in-depth interviews with teachers in eight primary schools. We found that positive perceptions of the inspectors' credibility enhance teachers' feedback acceptance. This is also the case for positive, clear feedback. Under these circumstances, emotions of joy, happiness and relief are expressed. Conversely, respondents tend to reject feedback when inspectors are perceived to be inadequately informed, arrogant or disrespectful. When negative feedback is rated as unfair, negative emotions, such as anger and sadness, interfere with feedback acceptance. In essence, we conclude that both feedback content and feedback source characteristics are decisive in the acceptance of process.

Currently, the Flemish education system has no standardized testing. The idea of implementing a monitoring system is highly contentious. By means of a Delphi study with policy makers, education specialists, school governors, principals, teachers, and a student representative (n=24), we identified the characteristics of a monitoring system that would be accepted by different stakeholders. Based on these characteristics, we proposed eight scenarios for future policy development. Next, the desirability of these scenarios was assessed by each respondent. The results show that in order to gain broad social support, a focus on strengthening trust is preferred over a focus on control through such measures as avoiding the public availability of test results.

Judges compare two pieces of student work and judge which of both is better regarding the competence assessed. Using these pairwise comparison data, students work is scaled according to its quality. Since student work is highly information loaded and heterogeneous of nature, this raises the question whether judges can handle this type of complex judgments? However, research into the complexity of CJ and its relation with decision accuracy is currently lacking. Therefore, this study initiates a theoretical framework on the complexity of CJ and relates it to decision accuracy. Based on this framework, two hypotheses are formulated and their plausibility is examined. The first hypothesis states that the distance between two pieces of student work on the rank-order (rank-order distance) is negatively related to experienced complexity, irrespectively of decision accuracy. In contrast, hypothesis 2 expects decision accuracy to moderate the relation between rank-order distance and experienced complexity. A negative relation is expected for accurate decisions. Meanwhile, inaccurate decisions are assumed to result in higher experienced complexity than accurate decisions, irrespective of rank-order distance. In both hypotheses, judges are expected to vary in mean experienced complexity as well as in the strength of the expected relationship between rank-order distance and experienced complexity. Using an information-theoretic approach, both hypotheses are translated into a statistical model and their relative fit is assessed. All analyses are replicated on three samples. Sample 1 and 2 comprise CJ data on the assessment of writing, while sample 3 contains pairwise comparison data on the assessment of visual arts. In all samples, results unambiguously confirm the moderating role of decision accuracy (hypothesis 2). Inaccurate decisions are experienced as more complex than accurate decisions, irrespective of rank-order distance. Meanwhile, for accurate decisions, rank-order distance is negatively related to experienced complexity. In line with expectations, differences between judges are found in mean experienced complexity and in the strength of the relationship between rank-order distance and experienced complexity. Suggestions for further theory development are formulated based on the results of this study.","tags":null,"title":"The complexity of assessing student work using comparative judgment : the moderating role of decision accuracy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liesje Coertjens","Vincent Donche","Sven De Maeyer","Tine van Daal","Peter Van Petegem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"2db767e4e4c7099462faeb3589945574","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-139922-coer-grow/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.54122Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-139922-coer-grow/","section":"publication","summary":"As in many OECD countries, the first year in Flemish Higher Education is a major hurdle.

Ideally, open and real-life tasks are used for such performance assessment. However, to augment the reliability of the scores resulting from performance assessment, assessments are mostly standardised. This hampers the validity of the performance assessment. Comparative judgement (CJ) is introduced as an alternative judging method that does not require standardisation of tasks. The CJ method is based on the assumption that people are able to compare two performances more easily and reliable than assigning a score to a single one. This chapter provides insight in the method and elaborates on why this method is promising to generate valid, reliable measures in an efficient way, especially for large-scale summative assessments. Thereby, this chapter brings together the research already conducted in this new assessment domain.","tags":null,"title":"Comparative judgement as a promising alternative to score competences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gert Vanthournout","K.

The study investigates the extent to which strategic activities, disturbing effects and emotional side effects occur in the case schools.

Most research to date has been conducted in England, which is considered a high-stakes inspection context whilst low-stakes inspection contexts are generally regarded as causing fewer undesirable side effects. This hypothesis, however, is not confirmed by the results of this study. Although the Flemish education context provides a low-stakes inspection context, schools in this study engage strongly in strategic activities to produce a better image of the school and school staff members suffer from severe emotional side effects due to the inspection. By contrast, only limited disturbing effects on normal school life were observed. These side effects are affected by principals attitude towards the inspection, by schools perception of inspectors behaviour and by the inspection judgement.

This is not surprising, as studies have shown that the enhancement of the entrepreneurial spirit can make an effective contribution to sustainable economic growth. Moreover, scholars have confirmed that the entrepreneurial spirit can be enhanced through entrepreneurship education. One important gap in the scientific literature in this area involves research on the evaluation of such education. The focus of this study is on developing an instrument in which scaled behavioural indicators will be used as a basis for giving concrete feedback to the students instead of using Likert-scale surveys. Based on a criterion-driven literature study 11 sub-competences that together constitute entrepreneurship in a behaviour-oriented and for educational purposes feasible way have been defined. These sub-competences were further subdivided into various behavioural indicators, which formed the basis for creating an evaluation instrument. Next the instrument has been validated in a sample of 201 secondary education students at the beginning of an EE-trajectory. The validity and reliability of the resulting instrument was tested through a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The validity check revealed a strong cohesion of the sub-competences we distinguished from the review, which is coherent with research that defines entrepreneurial competency as an over-arching construct. Finally 21 items were retained in an instrument that is sufficiently reliable and valid to warrant further application in the coaching of entrepreneurship education. To conclude the opportunities for fostering entrepreneurship education by using this instrument are discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of entrepreneurial competence through scaled behavioural indicators : validation of an instrument","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maarten Penninckx","Jan Vanhoof","Sven De Maeyer","Peter Van Petegem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"8c27babbd8691f0cba6d19b71edc4a78","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-127631-penn-expl/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.51779Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-127631-penn-expl/","section":"publication","summary":"There are large differences between schools with regard to how they are affected by a school inspection.

The formants, the surface area of the vowel space and the acoustic differentiation between the vowels were determined. The analyses revealed that many of the vowels in hearing-impaired children showed a reduction of the formant values. This reduction was particularly significant with respect to F2.

In contrast, there is a rather limited use of more direct and online observation techniques to uncover differences in processing strategies at a task specific level. We based our study on one of the most influential studies in the domain of Students Approaches to Learning (SAL) (Marton, Dahlgren, Saljo, \u0026 Svensson, 1975). In our exploratory experiment we used eye tracking followed by a cued recall to investigate how students use processing strategies in learning from expository text. Nineteen university students participated in the experiment. Results suggested that students in the deep condition did not look longer at the essentials in the text compared with students in the surface condition, but that they processed them in a more deep way. In our sample, students in the surface condition looked longer at facts and details and also reported repeating these facts and details more often. We suggest that the combination of eye tracking followed by a cued recall is a promising tool to investigate students processing strategies since not all differences in processing strategies are reflected in overt eye movement behaviour. The current methodology allows researchers in the domain of SAL to complement and extend the present knowledge base that has accumulated through years of research with self-report questionnaires and interviews on students general preferences towards processing strategies.","tags":null,"title":"Mapping processing strategies in learning from expository tekst : an exploratory eye tracking study followed by a cued recall","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Q.

To overcome this decrease several countries implemented mandatory technology classes in the curriculum of secondary education. Purpose: This study has two goals: exploring the evolution of pupils' interest during the year(s) they attend the mandatory technology classes and exploring determining characteristics for differences in boys' and girls' attitude change over time. Sample: This study focuses on data gathered in the first and second grade of the first cycle in general secondary education in the North region of Belgium, Flanders. In a first stage we selected a good representation of geographically spread schools (n=20), from which over 1300 students participated. Design and methods: A longitudinal study with eight measurement occasions spread over the course of two years is presented in order to capture the evolution of students' attitudes, making use of a multilevel growth model analysis. Results: The results show that students' interest in technology decreases over time, although at the end of each grade interest is increasing again. Boys' and girls' interest in technology also evolves a little different in the first cycle of secondary education. For career aspirations we didn't see any significant difference between boys and girls. Boys' and girls' aspirations decrease over time with a little increase by the end of the second grade. Students with a more technological curriculum also have more career aspirations in the field of technology than their peers with other curricula. Although students' perceptions about technology as a subject for boys and girls are largely stable. Conclusions: The evolution of students' attitude is far from linear, this strengthens us in the choice for a more complex analysis model and the choice for more measuring points than only at the beginning and the end when analysing students' attitudes towards technology. With this research we found that students interest and aspirations in the field of technology are not stable and do change in the first cycle of secondary education. Overall, we can conclude that if the goal of technology education at school maintains to promote 'a larger number of students in technological oriented studies and professions', there is still much to do.","tags":null,"title":"A longitudinal study on boys and girls career aspirations and interest in technology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Konig","Gerhard Messmann","Regina H.

In dit artikel wordt ingegaan op deze problematiek en wordt een alternatieve benadering voorgesteld, de comparatieve beoordelingsmethode (CB). In CB wordt aan beoordelaars gevraagd prestaties van studenten te vergelijken en aan te geven welke het best presteert in termen van de te beoordelen competentie. Door meerdere vergelijkingen op te lossen kan een rangorde gegenereerd worden van beste naar minst goede prestatie. Betrouwbaarheid wordt nagestreefd door meerdere beoordelaars prestaties meerdere keren te laten beoordelen. Daarnaast stelt de methode meer valide te zijn, omdat de beoordelaars hun keuze baseren op basis van een holistische evaluatie van de prestaties en de taak voor studenten kan meer open geformuleerd worden.

Mothers of hearing-impaired children are shown to use less speech in interactions with their children than mothers of normally hearing children. We aim to investigate whether this observation also holds for mothers of CI children. Methods Transcriptions of spontaneous conversations of ten CI children and ten NH children were analysed. We examined whether mothers responded to their children's utterances and whether they repeated or incorporated them in their own follow-up. Conversations were analysed in two consecutive stages, namely a prelexical stage and a lexical one. Results Mothers of CI children responded significantly more often to their children's utterances in both the prelexical and lexical stage. They also incorporated their children's utterances more often, however this was only significant in the lexical stage. The type of child utterance was an important trigger for the amount of mothers responses. All mothers responded significantly more often to lexical utterances in the lexical stage. In the prelexical stage, however, precanonical utterances received the same amount of responses as canonical babbles. Nevertheless, all mothers incorporated canonical babbles more often than precanonical vocalisations in the prelexical stage and lexical utterances more often in the lexical stage.

Results based on analyses of variance and multilevel analyses suggested three key findings: (a) Faculty members in different stages of instructional development varied in the size of their network; (b) faculty members in different stages of development had access to different types of networks in terms of tie strength; and (c) faculty members in different stages of development varied in the diversity of teaching experience in their networks. Experienced expert teachers had larger, stronger, and more diverse networks compared with experienced non-experts. Novices also had larger networks, but they were characterized by lower tie strength and less diversity. These findings demonstrate that network development is not just a timeage effect, but suggests arrested development for experienced non-experts linked to limited network input. This provides important evidence for the role of collegial interactions throughout facultys development as a teacher. We further discuss the implications of this study in light of faculty members instructional development.","tags":null,"title":"Know-who?

Young people are interested in technological products, but their opinions on education and careers in technology are not particularly positive (Johansson in Mathematics, science \u0026 technology education report. European Round Table of Industrials, Brussel, 2009). If we want to stimulate students attitudes towards technology we need to have a better understanding of the factors which determine attitudes. Different studies (e.g. Volk and Yip in Int J Technol Des Educ 9:5771, 1999; Jones et al. in Sci Educ 84(2):180192, 2000; George in Int J Sci Educ 28(6):571589, 2006; Salminen-Karlsson in Int J Sci Educ 29(8):10191033, 2007) have proven that students characteristics correlate with their attitudes towards technology. As these studies often focus on effects on a specific aspect of attitude; the total effect cannot be interpreted correctly because attitude is a multi-dimensional concept (Osborne et al. in Int J Sci Educ 23(5):441467, 2003). This study focuses upon six aspects of attitude namely: interest, career aspirations, boredom, consequences, difficulty and gender issues. Therefore a multivariate model has been set up. This allows us to answer the main research question: What is the predictive power of students characteristics with regard to aspects of their attitudes towards technology? The revalidated version of the Pupils Attitude Towards Technology instrument (Ardies et al. in Des Technol Educ 18(1):819, 2013) was used in a large (n = 2,973) scale investigation of 1214 year old students (Grade 1 and Grade 2 of secondary education). Given the multilevel nature of the data and that students are allocated to specific teachers, we analysed the data with a multivariate multilevel approach. The results of the study show a decline in interest in technology from the first to the second grade of secondary education. This finding appears to be stronger for girls. Interest in technology is significantly positively related to the amount of time that technology is taught for, as well as to the teacher. Parents have a positive influence on several aspects of attitude to technology when mothers and/or fathers have a profession related to technology. Equally, the presence of technological toys at home is a significantly positive characteristic. As the results confirmed previous, fragmented studies in related disciplines like science education, this study contributes to the wider body of knowledge concerning students attitudes towards technology and how this can be investigated.","tags":null,"title":"Students attitudes towards technology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anca Daniela Frumuselu","Sven De Maeyer","Vincent Donche","Maria del Mar Gutierrez Colon Plana"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"f7da025b3a34e5b3891b48de6bd62860","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-128850-dani-tele/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.520755Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-128850-dani-tele/","section":"publication","summary":"This experimental study seeks to explore informal and conversational speech, such as slang,phrasal verbs and colloquial expressions through the use of subtitled TV series (interlingualand intralingual) amongst learners in higher education.

Daartoe hebben we vijf onderzoekslijnen. Elk van de vijf doctoraatstudenten stelt haar of zijn lijn hier kort voor.\nLijn 1 – Het grote EDO doel : actiecompetentie Onderzoekster : Wanda Sass\nIn deze onderzoekslijn wordt het begrip actiecompetentie verder onderzocht. We zien actiecompetentie als het geheel van drie onderdelen: (1) de wil om een actief engagement aan te gaan voor duurzaamheid, (2) kennis van (eigen) actiemogelijkheden, en (3) het vertrouwen in de eigen kunde om actie te ondernemen. Ik werk hiervoor een vernieuw conceptueel kader uit en ook diverse meetinstrumenten.\nLijn 2 – Professionele ontwikkeling van schoolteams Onderzoekster : Kirsten Bonte\nDe onderzoekslijn brengt het EDO professionaliseringstraject van leerkrachten in kaart. We onderzoeken hoe de persoonlijke overtuigingen van leerkrachten m.b.t. leergemeenschap van invloed zijn op hun leergedragingen. Ook gaan we na wat de effecten zijn van het professionaliseringstraject op de EDO competenties van leerkrachten en op het EDO materiaal dat ze ontwerpen om te gebruiken in de klas.\nLijn 3 – Effecten van EDO op leerlingen Onderzoekster : Eleni Sinakou\nIn deze onderzoekslijn verkennen we de effecten van het EDO professionaliseringstraject op leerkrachten en op leerlingen. Het traject heeft als doel om de leraren te ondersteunen in het opzetten van onderwijsarrangementen in het kader voor Educatie voor Duurzame Ontwikkeling. We bestuderen ook of en hoe deze praktijken bij kunnen dragen aan de actiecompetentie van leerlingen.\nLijn 4 – EDO schoolcultuur en –beleid Onderzoeker : Dries Verhelst\nGeen twee scholen zijn dezelfde, en het binnenbrengen van innovaties (zoals Educatie voor Duurzame Ontwikkeling) in het onderwijs hangt sterk samen met de aard van de school. In deze onderzoekslijn bestuderen we de schoolcultuur en de schoolse beleidsvoering rond EDO. Ook de impact van cultuur en beleid op het al dan niet succesvol implementeren van EDO hoort daarbij.\nLijn 5 – EDO buiten de schoolmuren Onderzoek(st)er : De aanwerving loopt 🙂\nKinderen brengen een belangrijk deel van hun tijd door op school. Ze brengen echter ook een belangrijk deel van hun tijd niet op school door. Deze onderzoekslijn wil vat krijgen op het samenspel tussen de thuissituatie en de schoolse context als het aankomt op de duurzaamheidsattitudes van leerlingen. Daarnaast verkennen we ook of en in welke mate EDO op school via de leerlingen kan doorsijpelen tot in het gezin.\n","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560062001,"objectID":"d1f4f2516ba3ac7e33f9023f9cc36c19","permalink":"/project/valies-project/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/valies-project/","section":"project","summary":"VALIES project on Education for Sustainable Development","tags":["Comparative Judgement","Educational Assessment","IWT-SBO"],"title":"","type":"project"},{"authors":["Maarten Penninckx","Jan Vanhoof","Sven De Maeyer","Peter Van Petegem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"3eae73d45ae0b3d6a71c61c0297b5dae","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-117862-penn-expl/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.501756Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-117862-penn-expl/","section":"publication","summary":"This study looks into the effects of school inspection in the context of Flemish education.

Results indicated that the perceptions of the help providers expertise, accessibility and trust were positively associated with the likelihood to seek help, frequency by which help is sought, and perceived quality of the help. Moreover, employees seem more likely to seek help upward from higher status individuals and less likely downward from lower status individuals. Employees perceived the help of higher status individuals as more useful and constructive.

Aims Previous studies have often investigated how student learning is associated with either personal or contextual factors. This study takes an integrative research perspective into account and examines the joint effects of personality, academic motivation, and teaching strategies on students' learning strategies in a same educational context in first-year higher education. Sample In this study, 1,126 undergraduate students and 90 lecturers from eight professional bachelor programmes in a university college participated. Methods Self-report measures were used to measure students' personality, academic motivation, and learning strategies. Students' processing and regulation strategies are mapped using the Inventory of Learning Styles. Key characteristics of more content-focused versus learning-focused teaching strategies were measured. Multivariate multi-level analysis was used to take the nested data structure and interrelatedness of learning strategies into account. Results Different personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism) and academic motivation (amotivation, autonomous, and controlled motivation) were found to be independently associated with student learning strategies. Besides these student characteristics, also teaching strategies were found to be directly associated with learning strategies. Conclusions The study makes clear that the impact of teaching strategies on learning strategies in first-year higher education cannot be overlooked nor overinterpreted, due to the importance of students' personality and academic motivation which also partly explain why students learn the way they do.","tags":null,"title":"Differential use of learning strategies in first-year higher education : the impact of personality, academic motivation, and teaching strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ann Stes","Sven De Maeyer","David Gijbels","Peter Van Petegem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"744b196d884aa996dcae3ce8addd8a40","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-88751-stes-effe/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.73765Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-88751-stes-effe/","section":"publication","summary":"Evidence regarding the impact of teachers' instructional development on student learning in higher education is scarce.

Furthermore, research is largely restricted to frequent word classes (nouns, verbs). The present study targets the acquisition of adjectives (e.g. big, intelligent) by children implanted before their second birthday. Adjectives constitute a relatively infrequent, but functionally important word class and were shown to be good indicators of language delays and impairments. Method: Nine cochlear-implanted (CI) children and 60 age-matched normally hearing (NH) controls participated in the study. The CI children were followed longitudinally from ages 2 to 7; control data were collected in a cross-sectional manner (10 children per age group). Samples of children's spontaneous interactions with their caregivers were transcribed and analyzed for adjective use (frequency, lexical diversity, complexity of syntactic constructions, and morphological correctness). Results: The performance of the CI subjects was not significantly different from that of NH peers on adjective frequency and lexical diversity. On these measures, both groups reached adult levels by age 3. However, the CI group had a significant delay in the acquisition of complex syntactic constructions. The NH subjects produced adjectives in adult-like grammatical constructions from age 3 onwards, whereas their CI peers lagged behind until age 5. The speech of the CI participants also featured morphological errors that are not characteristic of typical development (inflection of predicative adjectives). However, the overall error rate was low. Conclusions: The findings suggest that CI children have particular difficulty with grammatical items (bound morphemes, copulas) that are less salient in the flow of speech than content words. Nevertheless, children implanted before their second birthday are able to catch up with their hearing peers by age 5, even in the use of relatively infrequent word classes.

Although the studies on this topic are increasingly longitudinal, analyses have continued to rely primarily on traditional statistical methods. The present research is innovative in the way it uses a multi-indicator latent growth analysis in order to more accurately estimate the general and differential development in learning strategy scales. Moreover, the predictive strength of the latent growth models are estimated. The sample consists of one cohort of Flemish University College students, 245 of whom participated in the three measurement waves by filling out the processing and regulation strategies scales of the Inventory of Learning Styles Short Versions. Independent-samples t-tests revealed that the longitudinal group is a non-random subset of students starting University College. For each scale, a multi-indicator latent growth model is estimated using Mplus 6.1. Results suggest that, on average, during higher education, students persisting in their studies in a non-delayed manner seem to shift towards high-quality learning and away from undirected and surfaceoriented learning. Moreover, students from the longitudinal group are found to vary in their initial levels, while, unexpectedly, not in their change over time. Although the growth models fit the data well, significant residual variances in the latent factors remain.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling change in learning strategies throughout higher education : a multi-indicator latent growth perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Ardies","Sven De Maeyer","David Gijbels"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"2021f8152728426ba3c2718d80a22a93","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-105639-ardi-reco/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.484877Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-105639-ardi-reco/","section":"publication","summary":"In knowledge based economies technological literacy is gaining interest.

While many factors determine the choice of strategy, cognitive effort is a major contributor to this choice. This research shows how cognitive effort during error analysis affects strategy choice and success as measured by a series of online text production measures. We hypothesize that error correction with speech recognition software differs from error correction with keyboard for two reasons. Speech produces auditory commands and, consequently, different error types. The study reported on here measured the effects of (1) mode of presentation (auditory or visualtactile), (2) error span, whether the error spans more or less than two characters, and (3) lexicality, whether the text error comprises an existing word. A multilevel analysis was conducted to take into account the hierarchical nature of these data. For each variable (interference reaction time, preparation time, production time, immediacy of error correction, and accuracy of error correction), multilevel regression models are presented. As such, we take into account possible disturbing person characteristics while testing the effect of the different conditions and error types at the sentence level. The results show that writers delay error correction more often when the TPSF is read out aloud first. The auditory property of speech seems to free resources for the primary task of writing, i.e. text production. Moreover, the results show that large errors in the TPSF require more cognitive effort, and are solved with a higher accuracy than small errors. The latter also holds for the correction of small errors that result in non-existing words.","tags":null,"title":"Coordinating sentence composition with error correction : a multilevel analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

This is reflected in an increase in environmental education research focussing on childrens awareness and attitudes toward the environment. In this study, we focused on this issue from a school effectiveness perspective and evaluated (a) which student characteristics predict environmental attitudes and awareness, (b) whether schools make a difference in their students environmental attitudes and awareness and (c) if school effects are different for students with varying levels of science ability. The cross-sectional Flemish data of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developments Programme for International Student Assessment 2006 (4,999 students in 156 schools) were re-analysed using a multivariate multilevel model to address these issues. Results show that gender, immigrant status, socioeconomic status and educational track are important in explaining students environmental attitudes and awareness. Furthermore, the results show that schools do matter; schools in which science is taught in a more hands-on manner are associated with higher student environmental awareness whilst environmental learning activities are associated with more pro-environmental attitudes amongst students. After controlling for student characteristics, these school effects do not differ between more science-literate children and their less or average science-literate peers.","tags":null,"title":"Do schools make a difference in their students' environmental attitudes and awareness?

One of these choices relates to the criterion or criteria the researcher wishes to use to compare schools. Should, for example, a school be deemed effective if it achieves high performances in mathematics, or in mother tongue or in both? In order to safeguard the construct validity of the concept school effectiveness this type of research should include multiple effectiveness criteria and thus reduce the risk of mono-operation bias. In that case two analysis strategies can be used: a series of univariate analyses (one for each output measure); or a multivariate model in which different dependent variables are modelled at the same time. In this methodological review we will examine what the implications of these different analysis methods are for research results. The dataset is derived from a large-scale effectiveness study conducted into technical and vocational secondary education in Flanders. Based on the results of this study we will make methodological suggestions for researchers in the field of educational effectiveness and school leadership.","tags":null,"title":"Effectiveness criteria in school effectiveness studies: further research on the choice for a multivariate model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gert Vanthournout","Sven De Maeyer","Vincent Donche","David Gijbels","Peter Van Petegem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"0c2d00275add5190b1fc4cd295673158","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-82473-vant-expl/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.708133Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-82473-vant-expl/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploring patterns in learning and motivation: combining a variable oriented and a person oriented approach.

It is not directly determined by a child's medical diagnosis, but suggests SEN to be a product of the needed level of curricular adaptation and classroom support, and the child's broad category (cluster) of functional difficulties. A sample of 8648 pupils (aged 2.5-18) from regular and special education was assigned into the new matrix by collaborators of all 73 Centres for Pupils' Counselling (CPC), according to new criteria. Data were compared with current allocations. About 20% of children of primary school age have some kind of 'special' needs. 12.5 % of primary school aged children (8.9% of secondary school) have mild intellectual impairment and/or learning disability; and 3.3% (3.4%) have a diagnosed behavioural or autistic spectrum disorder. Using the new classification matrix, the number of children with SEN is much higher than before, but this reflects more the actual classroom reality and it allows a better estimation of true needs and resources, by the government as well as by the school. A matrix presentation of SEN as a 'product' of child characteristics and 'levels of curricular adaptations' seems to be a better answer to special needs than the present linear definition. We propose this broad matrix definition of SEN as an international standard in order to make figures across countries comparable. All staff will have to be trained to adopt a more needs-based, dynamic, contextual assessment system, based on a more social model of disability, taking into account contextual factors such as family and school environment, rather than the currently widely used psychometric way.","tags":null,"title":"Identifying special educational needs: putting a new framework for graded learning support to the test","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gert Vanthournout","Sven De Maeyer","David Gijbels","Vincent Donche","Peter Van Petegem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"1ce84d7de7df09ee571ad562d08dedd6","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-83337-vant-iden/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.714096Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-83337-vant-iden/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Identifying subgroups of students with different learning patterns: combining an exploratory and model-based approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liesje Coertjens","Vincent Donche","Peter Van Petegem","Sven De Maeyer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"c3887e903dfae126858c1448e83b44be","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-83338-coer-long/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.715634Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-83338-coer-long/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Longitudinale factorstabiliteit van leerstrategieen in het hoger onderwijs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Van Petegem","Nadine Engels","Sven De Maeyer","Mathea Simons","Gwendoline Hotton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"0baaa2c5c7f937fae5b8b03370786226","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-82710-van-ontw/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.709562Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-82710-van-ontw/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Ontwikkelingsdoelen en eindtermen: hoe gaan scholen er mee om?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Van Petegem","Sven De Maeyer","Stefanie Adriaensens","Eva Delvaux"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"dd142ed9d523eba3d5fae5c3645e7903","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-83236-van-part/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.71265Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-83236-van-part/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Participatie geevalueerd: evaluatie van het participatiedecreet in het Vlaams onderwijs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Inge Verbeeck","Sven De Maeyer","Rita Rymenans","M.

Writing samples of 106 third graders and 111 fourth graders of seven Flemish primary schools were collected at the beginning and at the end of the school year. Measures included one holistic primary trait judgement, and six objective indices of text quality. Student-level predictors included age, SES and home language, while the classroom-level predictor focused on the home language pattern of the classroom. There was a significant mean growth for each index in each grade, but effect sizes differed from quite large for content and word level indices over moderate for sentence level indices to small for the text level index. Home language (Turkish) had a significant negative effect on all but one variables, particularly in Grade 4, while the negative effect of low SES was much more limited. A supplementary negative effect was found for homogeneity of classroom population. Implications of the study highlight the importance of student and classroom characteristics in writing achievement as well as the need to consider the poor performance of Turkish children.","tags":null,"title":"Written narations by 8- to 10-year-old Turkish pupils in flemish primary education: a follow-up of seven text features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Vanhoof","Peter Van Petegem","Sven De Maeyer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"251d0ebba4d0b4f852dd9fe51af22c8a","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-75814-vanh-atti/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.677485Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-75814-vanh-atti/","section":"publication","summary":"Research reveals that a positive attitude towards self-evaluation is a pre-condition which favours successful school self-evaluation.

In dit artikel beschrijven we de houding ten aanzien van zelfevaluatie in scholen en onderzoeken we of schoolkenmerken verschillen in houding van individuen kunnen verklaren. We rapporteren over een survey-onderzoek bij 2.716 schoolleiders en leerkrachten in 96 scholen. Het onderzoek leert dat respondenten zich positiever uitspreken over de mogelijke resultaten van zelfevaluatie dan over het zelfevaluatieproces als dusdanig. Schoolleiders hebben bovendien een meer positieve houding dan leerkrachten. Meerniveau-analyses tonen aan dat de houding ten aanzien van zelfevaluatie samenhangt met de kenmerken van het ruimere functioneren van de school waarin men actief is (zoals schoolcultuur en het al dan niet voldoen aan kenmerken van een professionele leergemeenschap).","tags":null,"title":"De houding ten aanzien van schoolzelfevaluatie","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Dit gebeurde aan de hand van een bevraging van de volledige LOP-populatie en een diepgaande procesanalyse bij vier van de zeventig Vlaamse LOP's. Vier onderzoeksvragen stonden centraal en peilden naar verschillen in proces-, input-, output- en contextfactoren. Zijn de LOP's zoals nu decretaal bepaald een adequaat beleidsinstrument voor het realiseren van de beoogde doelstellingen in het GOK-decreet? Het onderzoek toont aan dat samenwerking en dialoog tussen verschillende partners op gang komen en dat het belangrijk is dat iedereen op een actieve en ondersteunde manier betrokken kan zijn. De betrokken actoren in de Vlaamse LOP's hebben de vrijheid om doelstellingen en acties te formuleren naar gelang hun specifieke context. Er is weinig aandacht voor formele en informele evaluatie. Doelen worden vaak op lange termijn geformuleerd, met de geest van het GOK-decreet in het achterhoofd.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluatie van het functioneren van de lokale overlegplatforms als beleidsinstrument voor gelijke onderwijskansen","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Van Petegem","Alexia Deneire","Sven De Maeyer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560074254,"objectID":"4549e7f0dcfe3c9f0e9f8c572d78d3e9","permalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-70732-van-eval/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T06:44:47.653996Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moto-c-irua-70732-van-eval/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes the validation of a self-evaluation instrument for teachers in secondary education to solicit feedback from their pupils regarding specific aspects of the teacher's practice in class. This 92-item instrument Teachers Learn from Pupils-Secondary Education (TLP-SE) assesses 10 relevant classroom environment dimensions: effective learning time, structured instruction, monitoring pupil's progress, feedback, high expectations, reinforcement, work climate in class, promoting self-reliance, harmonic personality development, and recognizing autonomy. A sample of 1140 secondary education pupils (c.q. 69 classes) from BelgiumFlanders responded to TLP-SE.

In the past, pupils’ assignments to classrooms and schools have often fostered segregation rather than encouraged inclusion. Today, we see a tendency towards more inclusive learning environments (cf. amongst others, the UN Convention of 2006, ratified by Belgium in 2009). However, this poses challenges to the professional development of (pre-service) teachers and teams. Consequently, the main objective of the project ‘POTENTIAL - Power to Teach All’, is to develop the competences of (pre-service) teachers and school teams to create inclusive learning environments.\nIn the spectrum of competences to create inclusive learning environments, two major objectives are distinguished:\n(A) appreciating and exploiting diversity in the classroom;\nApplying an intersectional perspective to education, reveals the fact that diversity is an inherent part of every classroom (Van Avermaet \u0026amp; Sierens, 2010). That is, every classroom consists of a diverse group of students, with regard to such characteristics as gender, age, socio-economic position, language, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, (dis)abilities, ethnic and cultural background, … In order for teachers to create maximal learning opportunities for each student, certain skills and attitudes are necessary. First, in order to create a positive classroom environment, teacher attitudes should be appreciative, considering the diversity present not as a barrier to teaching and learning, but as an opportunity. Second, didactical skills and knowhow to create a learning environment suited to the needs of every student, are crucial in creating inclusive learning environments.\n(B) realizing collaborative teaming in the school.\nCreating inclusive learning environments assumes that no individual or isolated teacher can expect to have all the knowledge required to meet the needs of all students in the classroom. Equitable learning environments require support for all different participants and a shared responsibility towards these participants (Killorana et al., 2014). Therefore, competences to realize collaborative teaming are necessary in order to successfully create inclusive learning environments (Hunt et al., 2003).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560062001,"objectID":"071928543ea8dca9acd84174a3050621","permalink":"/project/potential-project/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/potential-project/","section":"project","summary":"Potential","tags":["Inclusive Education","Professional Development","Videography","Social Network Analysis","IWT-SBO"],"title":"","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project Website\nIn Flanders TIMSS 2019 is executed by research group EduBROn and research Centre Quest at the Arteveldehogeschool.
