 abstract = {The Perception of Teaching Environment Inventory (PTE) (Prosser & Trigwell, 1997) was elaborated to easily investigate university teachers' perceptions of their teaching context. In this study we examine whether the Dutch version that we developed allows us to investigate these perceptions in a valid and reliable way. Data were gathered from 120 teachers of the University of Antwerp. Confirmatory factor analyses and a principal factor analysis with oblique rotation support a model with four sub factors. However the results of our study indicate that it is not evident to come to valid and reliable statements about university teacher's' perceptions of their teaching context. Consequently the PTE should be used in educational research or practice with caution. Further research into the cognitive validity of data gathered with the PTE or a replication of the original development study by Prosser and Trigwell would be valuable.},
